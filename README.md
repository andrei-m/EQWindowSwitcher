EQWindowSwitcher
================

EQWindowSwitcher makes it easier to bring one of set of identically-titled
windows to the foreground. Windows provides some out-of-the-box key chords to
switch to a particular application, e.g. win+3 to switch to the third
application on the task bar. If there are multiple copies of this application,
the best Windows can do is cycle through them.

EQWindowSwitcher assigns the chords alt+shift+N for N 1 through 4, for up to
four copies of the application. This is built to make it easier to switch to
a particular copy of EverQuest, but it can work for other applications with a
modifications.
